In order to run the code you need to have the ability to run iPython Notebooks. These are Jupyter notebooks running Anaconda with Python 2.7
"All the imports are at the top of the page (numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn)"
For the breast cancer data the data is available through scikit-learn and will be loaded from the script.
"For the image segmentation, I attached the data and it needs to be saved and loaded manually. Update the path in the script."

Run the code. This will produce all the graphs and accuracy tests. It will also have more that I didn't even include in the analysis.
There is a separate notebook for each of the algorithms.
